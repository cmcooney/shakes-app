        <div class="subtitle">The ARTFL Project</div>
	<div class="p"><p>The Project for American and French Research on the Treasury of the French Language (<a href="http://artfl-project.uchicago.edu">ARTFL</a>)
        is a cooperative enterprise of the Laboratoire <a href="http://www.atilf.fr">ATILF</a> (Analyse et Traitement Informatique de la Langue Française)
        of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (<a href="http://www.cnrs.fr">CNRS</a>), the <a href="http://humanities.uchicago.edu">
        Division of the Humanities</a>, and Electronic Text
        Services (<a href="http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/ets/">ETS</a>) of the <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu">University of Chicago</a>.</p>

	<div class="p"><p>In 1957 the French government initiated the creation of a new dictionary of the French language,
        the Trésor de la Langue Française. In order to provide access to a large body of word samples, it was decided
        to transcribe an extensive selection of French texts for use with a computer. Twenty years later, a corpus
        totaling some 150 million words had been created, representing a broad range of written French -- from novels and
        poetry to biology and mathematics -- stretching from the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="p"><p>It soon became apparent that this corpus of French texts was an important resource not only for
        lexicographers, but also for many other types of humanists and social scientists engaged in French studies -
        on both sides of the Atlantic. The result of this realization was American and French Research on the Treasury of
        the French Language (ARTFL) -- a cooperative project established in 1981 by the <i>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</i>
        and the University of Chicago.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="subtitle">The Databases</div>
	<div class="p"><p>At present, ARTFL's main corpus, ARTFL-FRANTEXT, consists of nearly 3,000 texts, ranging from
        classic works of French literature to various kinds of non-fiction prose and technical writing. The eighteenth,
        nineteenth and twentieth centuries are about equally represented, with a smaller selection of seventeenth century
        texts as well as some medieval and Renaissance texts.  Genres include novels, verse, theater, journalism, essays,
        correspondence, and treatises. Subjects include literary criticism, biology, history, economics, and philosophy.
        In most cases standard scholarly editions were used in converting the text into machine-readable form, and the
        data contain page references to these editions.  The FRANTEXT corpus is updated as new high-quality digital texts
        become available.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="p"><p>In addition to FRANTEXT, ARTFL has built hundreds of databases for researchers and students
        working in specialized disciplines and languages other than French.  Please see our Databases, Resources, and
        Collaborations pages for links to these projects.</p>
